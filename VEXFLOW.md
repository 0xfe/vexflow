This repository contains VexFlow version 4.2.

VexFlow 4.x will be maintained with bug fixes, but active development has moved to the VexFlow organization at https://github.com/vexflow/vexflow/.

VexFlow was created in 2010 by [Mohit Muthanna Cheppudira](https://github.com/0xfe), and has been worked on by [many contributors](https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow/graphs/contributors).

From 2021-2022, [Rodrigo Vilar](https://github.com/rvilarl) and [Ron Yeh](https://github.com/ronyeh) converted VexFlow to TypeScript, added support for ES modules, and improved the build and deployment process.

In 2023, VexFlow became an organization. The code was permanently forked from [this commit](https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow/commit/b16796b2138d1d8304f1aca6f0401f6c3e34c902):
