     * initial position of any stem-side articulation.
     *
     * This indicates that all objects should have their stave set before being
     * formatted. It can't be an optional if you want accurate vertical positioning.
     * Consistently positioned articulations that play nice with other modifiers
     * won't be possible until we stop relying on render-time formatting.

     * Ideally, when this function has completed, the vertical articulation positions
     * should be ready to render without further adjustment. But the current state
     * is far from this ideal.
