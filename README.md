# VexFlow

VexFlow is an open-source library for rendering music notation. It is written in TypeScript (compiled to ES6), and outputs scores to HTML Canvas and SVG. It works in browsers and also in Node.js projects (e.g., a command line script to save a score as a PDF).

The guide below refers to VexFlow 4. If you need to work with the previous version, follow the [version 3.0.9 tutorial.](https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow/wiki/VexFlow-3.0.9-Tutorial)

## Quick Start

The quickest way to add VexFlow to a web page is via a `<script>` tag.

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vexflow/build/cjs/vexflow.js"></script>
<script>
  // YOUR CODE GOES HERE
</script>
```

If your project uses a bundler, you can install VexFlow from npm:

```sh
npm install vexflow
```

Read our detailed guide on [integrating with VexFlow.](https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow/wiki/VexFlow-4-Tutorial)

## EasyScore

EasyScore is VexFlow's high-level API for creating music notation. On a web page containing a `<div id="output"></div>`, the following code displays a score:

```javascript
const { Factory, EasyScore, System } = Vex.Flow;

const vf = new Factory({
  renderer: { elementId: 'output', width: 500, height: 200 },
});

const score = vf.EasyScore();
const system = vf.System();

system
  .addStave({
    voices: [
      score.voice(score.notes('C#5/q, B4, A4, G#4', { stem: 'up' })),
      score.voice(score.notes('C#4/h, C#4', { stem: 'down' })),
    ],
  })
  .addClef('treble')
  .addTimeSignature('4/4');

vf.draw();
```

[See a running example of EasyScore here.](https://jsfiddle.net/xure9svb/)

## Native API

If you need more control, you can use the low-level VexFlow API. Below, we render a stave using SVG. [See a running example of the low-level API here.](https://jsfiddle.net/5zgf03un/)

```javascript
const { Renderer, Stave } = Vex.Flow;

// Create an SVG renderer and attach it to the DIV element with id="output".
const div = document.getElementById('output');
const renderer = new Renderer(div, Renderer.Backends.SVG);

// Configure the rendering context.
renderer.resize(500, 500);
const context = renderer.getContext();
context.setFont('Arial', 10);

// Create a stave of width 400 at position 10, 40.
const stave = new Stave(10, 40, 400);

// Add a clef and time signature.
stave.addClef('treble').addTimeSignature('4/4');

// Connect it to the rendering context and draw!
stave.setContext(context).draw();
```
