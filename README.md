## What is VexFlow?

VexFlow is an open-source web-based music notation rendering API. It is written
completely in JavaScript, and runs right in the browser. VexFlow supports HTML5
Canvas and SVG, and runs on all modern browsers.

Go try out [The VexFlow Tutorial](http://vexflow.com/docs/tutorial.html) to
learn how to use VexFlow.

If you're not a developer and just want to write and share your music, go to
[My VexFlow](http://my.vexflow.com).

## Quick Start

Install via NPM:

    $ npm install vexflow

Include `releases/vexflow-min.js` into your HTML or JS code. It works as a standalone script in a `script` tag, or as a CommonJS or AMD dependency.
