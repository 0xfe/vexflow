# Using VexFlow with ES Modules

Start a web server in the main `vexflow/` folder.

```shell
$ npx http-server

Starting up http-server, serving ./
Available on:
  http://127.0.0.1:8080
Hit CTRL-C to stop the server

```

Then load `module.html` in a browser by visiting http://127.0.0.1:8080/demos/modules/module.html

# Using VexFlow with CJS

The `script-tag.html` file can be loaded from the local file system (e.g., file:/// URL) or from a web server as in the ES modules example above.
